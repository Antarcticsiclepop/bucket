# Bucket Sort Animation (Borland C++)

This is a class project I made in 2015 using Turbo C. It's the bucket sort algorithm, I used the graphing tool to visualize the process.
Tip: Press 'ENTER' to play the animation when sorting (Option #4), press 'N' to interrupt the animation and to skip to the next frame.

# Executing

To execute the program launch 'bucket.bat' from the root folder, DOSBOX will take care of things.

# Source File

I have included my 'source file'. :)
